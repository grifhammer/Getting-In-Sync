# Your Task

Imagine you are given a set of log sources.  Each source is comprised of N log entries.  Each entry is a simple javascript object with a timestamp and message.  You don't know how many log entries each source has, BUT you do know that the entries within each source are sorted chronologically (that last bit is important).

Your mission is to print out all of the entries, across all of the sources, in chronological order.  You don't need to store the final collection of all the entries, literally just print them to console.  Some things to keep in mind:

* You don't know how long each log source is.  What if it had millions of entries and was terabytes in size?  (In other words, reading the entirety of a log source into memory probably wonâ€™t work well.)
* Some log sources could contain logs from last year, some from yesterday, you won't know the timeframe of a log source until you start looking.
* Consider what would happen when you're asked to merge 1K log sources, or even 1M log sources.  Where might your bottlenecks arise?

There are two parts of the challenge which you'll see when you dive into things.  You can get started with things by running `npm start`.

We expect candidates to spend 1-3 hours on this exercise.  By the way, you may use any third party modules you like, and by all means feel free to ask questions!

## Bottlenecks

In the Async implementation there is a significant bottleneck around making the asynchronous calls for new logs. Since I am keeping ony 1 log in memory at a time I have to make an asynchronous call to get a new message after every print. This could be alleviated if we made more requests and started chaching more logs per logSource. This then would require a bit of a change to the data map that is used to store the logs as well as some fine tuning to find the desired balance between speed/performance and memory usage.

In the synchronous implementation the main bottleneck is around doing a full sort of the data every time we get a new log. This could be made faster by changing this from the initial implementation to just traversing the already sorted logs and inserting the new log where it would fall chronologically. This along with a refactor to allow both synchronous and asynchronous implementations to share some utility code would provide a performance improvement to both solutions.
